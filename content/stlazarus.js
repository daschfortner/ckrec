For more than twenty years, a team of dedicated lay ministers from Christ
the King and Christ our Hope parishes in Dayton have partnered to form St.
Lazarus Mission, actively providing residents of local nursing homes with
ongoing pastoral care, "family" visits, and regular Sunday services.

We approach this ministry holistically, adopting everyone in the nursing
home â€” residents and families, staff and management. We love anyone and
everyone, Christian and non-Christian. We minister both to and with people,
enabling the least of these, the destitute and dying, and the otherwise
forgotten and put away, to be the local, missional church in each nursing
home where they live with purpose, for the glory of God instead of just
waiting to die.

We welcome other branches of Christ's Church. Accordingly, we foster parish
life including worship, comforting the dying and grieving, visiting the
bedridden and sick, fellowship, prayer, Bible learning, pastoral care,
special celebrations, friendships, and partaking of the sacraments. We
freely provide time-tested resources and support to help others begin and
sustain similar ministries.
