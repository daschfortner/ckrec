## No Longer Strangers

[![No Longer Strangers](/img/nls.png)](https://www.nolongerstrangers.org/)

The over-arching philosophy of [No Longer Strangers](https://www.nolongerstrangers.org/)
is to offer genuine Christian friendship to the refugee community. During the
resettlement process, refugees experience a bureaucratic whirlwind that often
produces a disturbing sense of bewilderment and isolation. As we befriend our
neighbors, we have many opportunities to provide assistance in practical matters,
but just as importantly, to laugh with them, share in their sorrows, and to
pray with them.

## St. Lazarus Mission

For more than twenty years, a team of dedicated lay ministers from Christ
the King and Christ our Hope parishes in Dayton have partnered to form 
[St. Lazarus Mission](http://lazarusmission.org/), actively providing 
residents of local nursing homes with ongoing pastoral care, "family" visits,
and regular Sunday services.

We approach this ministry holistically, adopting everyone in the nursing
home — residents and families, staff and management. We love anyone and
everyone, Christian and non-Christian. We minister both to and with people,
enabling the least of these, the destitute and dying, and the otherwise
forgotten and put away, to be the local, missional church in each nursing
home where they live with purpose, for the glory of God.

## Dominion Academy of Dayton

[![Dominion Academy](/img/dominion-academy.png)](http://dominionacademy.org)

[Dominion Academy of Dayton](http://dominionacademy.org) is a college preparatory school
providing a classical education based on the Bible, reason, and Tradition. It was founded
in  1998 by Fr. Wayne and Sandy McNamara.

They chose to name the school "Dominion Academy" out of the conviction that God has given
Christians the humbling role of "kings and priests" of all of Creation. Christians are to
exercise a loving, faithful, and wise stewardship over all things for the glory of our Lord.
In order to exercise this sobering trust with fidelity, Christians must learn
about the true shape of the world — a world existing in Christ, according to the order of the
Trinitarian community.

Christians must learn well in order to love well. Dominion Academy exists in order to educate
young Christians about the shape of the world in Christ and to encourage these
students to properly love creation, understanding that all ultimate meaning is found in
Christ alone.
