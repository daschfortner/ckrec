            The stranger who dwells among you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love
            him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. (Lev. 19:34)

          <a href="https://www.nlsrm.org/" target="_blank">No Longer Strangers</a> assists a large refugee
          community residing in our immediate parish neighborhood.
          They are from war-torn countries in eastern and central Africa such as Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan,
          Congo, Burundi, and Rwanda, and were resettled in Dayton from various refugee camps in Africa and
          Europe. Refugees receive federal assistance for a short period of time during which they must find
          employment and become self-sufficient. This is a daunting task in a foreign country!
        </p>

        <p>
          The over-arching philosophy of our ministry is to offer genuine Christian friendship to the refugee
          community. During the resettlement process, refugees experience a bureaucratic whirlwind that often
          produces a disturbing sense of bewilderment and isolation. As we befriend our neighbors, we have many
          opportunities to provide assistance in practical matters, but just as importantly, to laugh with them,
          share in their sorrows, and to pray with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our work includes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>English as a Second Language and literacy classes</li>

        </ul>
