          Our goal is to incorporate our children into every aspect of parish worship and life. We want
          their earliest memories to be imbued with the full sensory experience of Eucharistic celebration.
          Children are lovingly invited to our services to participate in the rhythms of the liturgy. In
          practice, this means that the sounds of children – ranging from laughter to cries – are viewed
          not as distractions, but reminders that we are all called to be as little children. Our children
          are not future members in training, but rather full members in the present: embraced, accepted,
          and joyfully welcomed into our corporate worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also means that we seek to create a Christian culture that engages and envelopes our families
          – a culture that radiates outward from the Table that we share on Sunday. Christ the King seeks to
          create opportunities both formal and informal for celebrating the rhythms of the church calendar
          together, outside of Sundays, with fun, food and fellowship. This means both encouraging rituals
          that families can practice together at home, and gathering as a congregation to share in traditions
          of the church year.

            <u>Godly Play Sunday School Program:</u> Available for ages 3-7, Godly Play is a program of Christian
            Education based on the Montessori Educational philosophy. Godly Play is based upon the recognition
            that children have an innate sense of the presence of God. All they lack is the appropriate language
            to help them identify and express it so it can be explored and strengthened. The Godly Play approach
            teaches classical Christian language in a way that enhances the child’s authentic experience of God so
            it can contribute to the creative life of the child and the world.
