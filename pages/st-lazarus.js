        <p>
          For more than twenty years, a team of dedicated lay ministers from Christ the King and
          Christ our Hope parishes in Dayton have partnered to form St. Lazarus Mission, actively
          providing residents of local nursing homes with ongoing pastoral care, "family" visits,
          and regular Sunday services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We approach this ministry holistically, adopting everyone in the nursing home â€” residents and
          families, staff and management. We love anyone and everyone, Christian and non-Christian.
          We minister both to and with people, enabling the least of these, the destitute and dying,
          and the otherwise forgotten and put away, to be the local, missional church in each nursing
          home where they live with purpose, for the glory of God instead of just waiting to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          We welcome other branches of Christ's Church. Accordingly, we foster parish life including
          worship, comforting the dying and grieving, visiting the bedridden and sick, fellowship,
          prayer, Bible learning, pastoral care, special celebrations, friendships, and partaking
          of the sacraments. We freely provide time-tested resources and support to help others begin
          and sustain similar ministries.
        </p>
