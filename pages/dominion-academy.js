          <a href="http://dominionacademy.org/" target="_blank"><u>Dominion Academy of Dayton</u></a> is a college
          preparatory school providing a classical education based on the Bible, reason, and Tradition. It was
          founded in  1998 by Fr. Wayne and Sandy McNamara. They chose to name the school "Dominion Academy"
          out of the conviction that God has given Christians the humbling role of "kings and priests" of all
          of Creation. Christians are to exercise a loving, faithful, and wise stewardship over all things for
          the glory of our Lord. In order to exercise this sobering trust with fidelity, Christians must learn
          about the true shape of the world â€” a world existing in Christ, according to the order of the
          Trinitarian community. Christians must learn well in order to love well. Dominion Academy exists in
          order to educate young Christians about the shape of the world in Christ and to encourage these
          students to properly love creation, understanding that all ultimate meaning is found in Christ alone.
