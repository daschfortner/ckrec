          <strong>Godly Play</strong>
        </h2>

        <p>
          Available for ages 3-7,  Godly Play is a program of Christian Education based on the
          Montessori Educational philosophy. Godly Play is based upon the recognition that children
          have an innate sense of the presence of God. All they lack is the appropriate language
          to help them identify and express it so it can be explored and strengthened. The Godly
          Play approach teaches classical Christian language in a way that enhances the child’s
          authentic experience of God so it can contribute to the creative life of the child and
          the world.

          Covering various topics and relevant for high school ages and up, the adult Sunday school
